in this post, i’ll look through some spelling reforms i like and perhaps criticize them. to see how easy they are to read, i’ll write each section in that reform.

## sr1

this isn’t a full spelling reform, but it is often brought up in spelling reform-related media. the point of sr1 (spelling reform step 1) is that each instance of /ɛ/ is spelled ‹e›. and that’s all. while most words *do* look natural and logical in this reform, some don’t.

the problem with this reform is that different accents pronounce words differently. “been” is pronounced with either /ɪ/ or /ɪj/ for most people, however in the usonian midwest, it’s pronounced with an /ɛ/! including the american english *pen*–*pin* merger (/ɛ/=/ɪ/ before nasals), it’s even less clear how to spell words. should “lint” be spelled “lent”, or should it still be spelled with an *i*? if so, is *i* the sr1 way of spelling /ɛ/ before nasal consonants now? but then not only would it be inconsistent, it would also make the word “bend” be spelled with an *i*, creating more confusion that was there before! and then there’s the way brits pronounce “lieutenant”…

### the other four

ther ar five total steps in that reform. the other four ar mor extreme, so i’m criticizing those as well.

dropping useless *e*s is mor-or-less fair, (or should it be “fer”? i hav /ɛː/ ther.) but, don’t get me wrong, seeing a *v* or a *z* at the end of words without an *e* looks very bizarr. an edge case for this rule would be the word “edge”: *dg* is always /ʤ/, however it is usually followd by an *e*

replacing *ph* with *f* is definitly a bad idea. *ph* in a word shows its etymology, and shows that thát word coms from greek. if we’r removing one etymological featur, it would make mor sens to remov mor. let’s replace “physical” with “fizzicle”! it looks more badass, that’s for tru.

the last two concern *`[ao]ugh`* tetragrafs.

the reform ses *augh* should be replaced by *au* when /oː/, and that’s fair. what isn’t, however, is it being transformed into *af* when “the sound is /f/”. that would be quite adequat, but not globally! english peopl say that word as /lɑːf/, surely *af* wouldn’t be a good spelling for that!

i’m pretty sure you can work out the criticism of *ough* yourself, it isn’t somthing needing to be mentioned yet agen. it’s an infamous and complicated tetragraf, yes, but most cases people complain about ar just pronunciations used in specific words. also this reform proposes “dough” being spelld “doh”.
